Two different types of function: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Variable-election collective choice rule} (VCCR): output `defeat' relation (an \emph{asymmetric binary relation}).
    \item \emph{Variable-election social choice correspondence} (VSCC): output a set of undefeated candidates.
\end{itemize}

Acyclic VCCR `induces a VSCC that returns for a given profile $\profile$ the maximal (undefeated) elements of $f (\profile)$.'
