Two different types of function: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Variable-election collective choice rule} (VCCR): output `defeat' relation (an \emph{asymmetric binary relation}).
    \item \emph{Variable-election social choice correspondence} (VSCC): output a set of undefeated candidates.
\end{itemize}

Another type of social choice function is \emph{variable-election social welfare function}, whose output is a strict weak order.

Acyclic VCCR `induces a VSCC that returns for a given profile $\profile$ the maximal (undefeated) elements of $f (\profile)$.'

The definition of Ranked Pairs as a VCCR somehow related to the proof of Theorem 5.39 in \textcite{Holliday2020} (?).
